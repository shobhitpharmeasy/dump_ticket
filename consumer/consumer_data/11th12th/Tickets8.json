It is your violation of guidelines that needs to be corrected not mine.<br><br>I am marking this to State Drug controller authority of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana for further action. <br>Dear sir/madam (State Drug Controller Authority - UP, Haryana) : Please review the invoice attached and investigate on this as this is sold without proper prescription reference and Pharmeasy as per trailing email is denying to correct their mistake.<br><br>Regards,<br>Abhijat Dwivedi<br>(M)+919873919059<br><br><br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"freshdesk_quote\"><blockquote class=\"freshdesk_quote\">\n<div>From: PharmEasy &lt;care@pharmeasy.in&gt;<br>Sent: Thu, 11 Dec 2025 20:10:53<br>To: abhijat76@rediffmail.com<br>Subject: Re: IncomingCall ticket for agent VS_salman_patel on 9873919059 (24865462363161846)<br> </div>\n<div style=\"font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica Neue, Arial, sans-serif; font-size:14px\"><div style=\"font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica Neue, Arial, sans-serif; font-size:14px\"><div dir=\"ltr\">\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\"><span style='font-size: 14px; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \"Segoe UI\", Roboto, \"Helvetica Neue\", Arial, sans-serif'>Hello,</span></div>\n<div style='box-sizing: border-box; word-break: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; font-size: 14px; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \"Segoe UI\", Roboto, \"Helvetica Neue\", Arial, sans-serif'> </div>\n</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style='font-size: 14px; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \"Segoe UI\", Roboto, \"Helvetica Neue\", Arial, sans-serif'>Greetings from PharmEasy! </div>\n<div style='font-size: 14px; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \"Segoe UI\", Roboto, \"Helvetica Neue\", Arial, sans-serif'> </div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style='font-size: 14px; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \"Segoe UI\", Roboto, \"Helvetica Neue\", Arial, sans-serif'>I understand your concern is regarding your order #633841392504913920-23610.

Senior Management,\r\n\r\nI am writing this email as a FINAL, URGENT, and HIGH-PRIORITY ESCALATION\r\nregarding the severe mishandling and procedural lapses associated with my\r\norder Order ID: 653726198280949760.\r\n\r\nI request you to read this email completely and carefully, as every point\r\nmentioned below is critical and requires immediate senior-level attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n1. Summary of the Issue – Missing and Wrong Medicines\r\n\r\nI had ordered 5 medicines/products under the above-mentioned order ID.\r\nHowever, during delivery:\r\n\r\nI received only 2 items,\r\n\r\nAnd both items were wrong/incorrect medicines,\r\n\r\nThe remaining 3 items were completely missing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not a minor operational error. This is a serious breach of order\r\nintegrity, especially in the pharmaceutical industry where accuracy\r\ndirectly affects customer health and safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n2. Incomplete and Procedurally Incorrect Investigation\r\n\r\nI was informed that my complaint was closed because your team reviewed only\r\nthe dispatch video and found no issue.\r\n\r\nWith due respect, I want to make it very clear that:\r\n\r\nA dispatch-level video alone does NOT constitute a complete investigation.\r\n\r\nA standard and fair investigation for missing or incorrect medicines must\r\ninclude:\r\n\r\nReview of CCTV footage from all hubs\r\n\r\nTransit-level verification of the parcel\r\n\r\nSorting-center camera checks\r\n\r\nDetailed chain-of-custody tracking\r\n\r\nWeight log comparison at every point\r\n\r\nVerification of movement and scan logs\r\n\r\nDelivery station handover footage\r\n\r\nRe-bagging or re-routing investigation\r\n\r\n\r\nClosing a serious complaint based only on the dispatch video is\r\noperationally incomplete, logically insufficient, and professionally\r\nunacceptable.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n3. Request for Full Chain-of-Custody Investigation\r\n\r\nI formally request PharmEasy to conduct a complete and transparent\r\nchain-of-custody investigation, including:\r\n\r\nA. CCTV Footage Review (Mandatory)\r\n\r\nYou must review the CCTV footage of:\r\n\r\nPacking center\r\n\r\nFirst sorting warehouse\r\n\r\nEvery transit and routing hub\r\n\r\nRegional processing centers\r\n\r\nFinal delivery hub\r\n\r\nDelivery station sorting area\r\n\r\nPick-up and handover section\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Verification of Weight Logs\r\n\r\nA detailed comparison of:\r\n\r\nInitial package weight at the origin\r\n\r\nWeight during each hub scan\r\n\r\nWeight during re-bagging\r\n\r\nFinal delivery station weight\r\n\r\n\r\nAny mismatch will clearly show missing items.\r\n\r\nC. Movement & Scan Audit\r\n\r\nA full audit should include:\r\n\r\nOutbound scan\r\n\r\nInbound scans at all hubs\r\n\r\nRouting details\r\n\r\nSorting belt entries\r\n\r\nDelivery executive pickup scan\r\n\r\nRe-scan or re-routing logs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n4. Request for Transparency – Provide Relevant CCTV Footage\r\n\r\nOnce the investigation is completed, I request that the relevant CCTV\r\nfootage, including:\r\n\r\nPacking\r\n\r\nSorting\r\n\r\nHub movement\r\n\r\nDelivery station handling\r\n\r\n\r\nbe shared with me for transparency, as I have every right to verify how my\r\nparcel was handled at each stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n5. Strong Red Flags Indicating Mishandling\r\n\r\nReceiving:\r\n\r\nWrong items,\r\n\r\nMissing items,\r\n\r\nIncorrect delivery quantity,\r\n\r\n\r\nclearly indicates that:\r\n\r\nThe parcel was either mishandled during transit,\r\nor\r\n\r\nIncorrectly sorted or packed,\r\nor\r\n\r\nMisrouted at a particular hub,\r\nor\r\n\r\nTampered with or misplaced during the chain movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly a thorough multi-hub investigation can find the exact failure point.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n6. Immediate and Suitable Resolution Expected\r\n\r\nConsidering the severity of the issue, I expect PharmEasy to provide one of\r\nthe following resolutions:\r\n\r\n✔ Option 1: Replacement\r\n\r\nProvide all the correct medicines/products that I originally ordered.\r\n\r\n✔ Option 2: Full Refund\r\n\r\nIf replacement is not possible, initiate a complete refund for all missing\r\nand incorrect items.\r\n\r\nA fair and customer-centric resolution is expected and required.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n7. Urgent Actions Required\r\n\r\nPlease proceed with:\r\n\r\n1. Reopening my complaint\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Initiating a multi-hub chain-of-custody audit\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Reviewing all hub CCTV footage\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Verifying weight logs\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Sharing relevant CCTV footage with me\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Providing either replacement or refund\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Ensuring accountability through internal teams\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n8. Final Warning Before External Escalation\r\n\r\nI want to state clearly, respectfully, and firmly:\r\n\r\nIf this complaint is again closed without:\r\n\r\nA complete CCTV review,\r\n\r\nA full chain-of-custody audit,\r\n\r\nA transparent and justified resolution,\r\n\r\n\r\nI will be left with no choice but to escalate this matter further to:\r\n\r\nPharmEasy Senior Executive Leadership\r\n\r\nNational Consumer Helpline (Government of India)\r\n\r\nConsumer Court under Consumer Protection Act, 2019\r\n\r\nRelevant Pharmaceutical Regulatory Authorities\r\n\r\nAny other legal body as applicable\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope PharmEasy will resolve the matter before such steps become necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n9. Conclusion\r\n\r\nPharmEasy is expected to maintain the highest standards of safety,\r\naccuracy, and transparency, especially when dealing with healthcare\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nAll I seek is:\r\n\r\nA complete and professional investigation\r\n\r\nTransparent communication\r\n\r\nA fair resolution (replacement or refund)\r\n\r\n\r\nI trust your team will handle this matter with the seriousness it deserves\r\nand respond urgently.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\nRohan\r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\n\r\nThis email contains proprietary, business-confidential, \r\nand/or privileged material.

Chain-of-Custody Audit, Full Multi-Hub CCTV Verification & Immediate Resolution | Order ID: 653726198280949760  \n      Description:  \n   \n Dear PharmEasy Customer Support Team, \n Grievance Redressal Department, \n and Senior Management, \n   \n I am writing this email as a FINAL, URGENT, and HIGH-PRIORITY ESCALATION regarding the severe mishandling and procedural lapses associated with my order Order ID: 653726198280949760. \n   \n I request you to read this email completely and carefully, as every point mentioned below is critical and requires immediate senior-level attention. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 1. Summary of the Issue – Missing and Wrong Medicines \n   \n I had ordered 5 medicines/products under the above-mentioned order ID. \n However, during delivery: \n   \n I received only 2 items, \n   \n And both items were wrong/incorrect medicines, \n   \n The remaining 3 items were completely missing. \n   \n   \n This is not a minor operational error. This is a serious breach of order integrity, especially in the pharmaceutical industry where accuracy directly affects customer health and safety. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 2. Incomplete and Procedurally Incorrect Investigation \n   \n I was informed that my complaint was closed because your team reviewed only the dispatch video and found no issue. \n   \n With due respect, I want to make it very clear that: \n   \n A dispatch-level video alone does NOT constitute a complete investigation. \n   \n A standard and fair investigation for missing or incorrect medicines must include: \n   \n Review of CCTV footage from all hubs \n   \n Transit-level verification of the parcel \n   \n Sorting-center camera checks \n   \n Detailed chain-of-custody tracking \n   \n Weight log comparison at every point \n   \n Verification of movement and scan logs \n   \n Delivery station handover footage \n   \n Re-bagging or re-routing investigation \n   \n   \n Closing a serious complaint based only on the dispatch video is operationally incomplete, logically insufficient, and professionally unacceptable. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 3. Request for Full Chain-of-Custody Investigation \n   \n I formally request PharmEasy to conduct a complete and transparent chain-of-custody investigation, including: \n   \n A. CCTV Footage Review (Mandatory) \n   \n You must review the CCTV footage of: \n   \n Packing center \n   \n First sorting warehouse \n   \n Every transit and routing hub \n   \n Regional processing centers \n   \n Final delivery hub \n   \n Delivery station sorting area \n   \n Pick-up and handover section \n   \n   \n B. Verification of Weight Logs \n   \n A detailed comparison of: \n   \n Initial package weight at the origin \n   \n Weight during each hub scan \n   \n Weight during re-bagging \n   \n Final delivery station weight \n   \n   \n Any mismatch will clearly show missing items. \n   \n C. Movement & Scan Audit \n   \n A full audit should include: \n   \n Outbound scan \n   \n Inbound scans at all hubs \n   \n Routing details \n   \n Sorting belt entries \n   \n Delivery executive pickup scan \n   \n Re-scan or re-routing logs \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 4. Request for Transparency – Provide Relevant CCTV Footage \n   \n Once the investigation is completed, I request that the relevant CCTV footage, including: \n   \n Packing \n   \n Sorting \n   \n Hub movement \n   \n Delivery station handling \n   \n   \n be shared with me for transparency, as I have every right to verify how my parcel was handled at each stage. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 5. Strong Red Flags Indicating Mishandling \n   \n Receiving: \n   \n Wrong items, \n   \n Missing items, \n   \n Incorrect delivery quantity, \n   \n   \n clearly indicates that: \n   \n The parcel was either mishandled during transit, \n or \n   \n Incorrectly sorted or packed, \n or \n   \n Misrouted at a particular hub, \n or \n   \n Tampered with or misplaced during the chain movement. \n   \n   \n Only a thorough multi-hub investigation can find the exact failure point. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 6. Immediate and Suitable Resolution Expected \n   \n Considering the severity of the issue, I expect PharmEasy to provide one of the following resolutions: \n   \n ✔ Option 1: Replacement \n   \n Provide all the correct medicines/products that I originally ordered. \n   \n ✔ Option 2: Full Refund \n   \n If replacement is not possible, initiate a complete refund for all missing and incorrect items. \n   \n A fair and customer-centric resolution is expected and required. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 7. Urgent Actions Required \n   \n Please proceed with: \n   \n 1. Reopening my complaint \n   \n   \n 2. Initiating a multi-hub chain-of-custody audit \n   \n   \n 3. Reviewing all hub CCTV footage \n   \n   \n 4. Verifying weight logs \n   \n   \n 5. Sharing relevant CCTV footage with me \n   \n   \n 6. Providing either replacement or refund \n   \n   \n 7. Ensuring accountability through internal teams \n   \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 8. Final Warning Before External Escalation \n   \n I want to state clearly, respectfully, and firmly: \n   \n If this complaint is again closed without: \n   \n A complete CCTV review, \n   \n A full chain-of-custody audit, \n   \n A transparent and justified resolution, \n   \n   \n I will be left with no choice but to escalate this matter further to: \n   \n PharmEasy Senior Executive Leadership \n   \n National Consumer Helpline (Government of India) \n   \n Consumer Court under Consumer Protection Act, 2019 \n   \n Relevant Pharmaceutical Regulatory Authorities \n   \n Any other legal body as applicable \n   \n   \n I hope PharmEasy will resolve the matter before such steps become necessary. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 9. Conclusion \n   \n PharmEasy is expected to maintain the highest standards of safety, accuracy, and transparency, especially when dealing with healthcare products. \n   \n All I seek is: \n   \n A complete and professional investigation \n   \n Transparent communication \n   \n A fair resolution (replacement or refund) \n   \n   \n I trust your team will handle this matter with the seriousness it deserves and respond urgently. \n   \n Warm regards, \n Rohan  \n   \n \n\n \n Disclaimer: \n This email contains proprietary, business-confidential, and/or privileged material.

Summary of the Issue – Missing and Wrong Medicines \n   \n I had ordered 5 medicines/products under the above-mentioned order ID. \n However, during delivery: \n   \n I received only 2 items, \n   \n And both items were wrong/incorrect medicines, \n   \n The remaining 3 items were completely missing. \n   \n   \n This is not a minor operational error. This is a serious breach of order integrity, especially in the pharmaceutical industry where accuracy directly affects customer health and safety. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 2. Incomplete and Procedurally Incorrect Investigation \n   \n I was informed that my complaint was closed because your team reviewed only the dispatch video and found no issue. \n   \n With due respect, I want to make it very clear that: \n   \n A dispatch-level video alone does NOT constitute a complete investigation. \n   \n A standard and fair investigation for missing or incorrect medicines must include: \n   \n Review of CCTV footage from all hubs \n   \n Transit-level verification of the parcel \n   \n Sorting-center camera checks \n   \n Detailed chain-of-custody tracking \n   \n Weight log comparison at every point \n   \n Verification of movement and scan logs \n   \n Delivery station handover footage \n   \n Re-bagging or re-routing investigation \n   \n   \n Closing a serious complaint based only on the dispatch video is operationally incomplete, logically insufficient, and professionally unacceptable. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 3. Request for Full Chain-of-Custody Investigation \n   \n I formally request PharmEasy to conduct a complete and transparent chain-of-custody investigation, including: \n   \n A. CCTV Footage Review (Mandatory) \n   \n You must review the CCTV footage of: \n   \n Packing center \n   \n First sorting warehouse \n   \n Every transit and routing hub \n   \n Regional processing centers \n   \n Final delivery hub \n   \n Delivery station sorting area \n   \n Pick-up and handover section \n   \n   \n B. Verification of Weight Logs \n   \n A detailed comparison of: \n   \n Initial package weight at the origin \n   \n Weight during each hub scan \n   \n Weight during re-bagging \n   \n Final delivery station weight \n   \n   \n Any mismatch will clearly show missing items. \n   \n C. Movement & Scan Audit \n   \n A full audit should include: \n   \n Outbound scan \n   \n Inbound scans at all hubs \n   \n Routing details \n   \n Sorting belt entries \n   \n Delivery executive pickup scan \n   \n Re-scan or re-routing logs \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 4. Request for Transparency – Provide Relevant CCTV Footage \n   \n Once the investigation is completed, I request that the relevant CCTV footage, including: \n   \n Packing \n   \n Sorting \n   \n Hub movement \n   \n Delivery station handling \n   \n   \n be shared with me for transparency, as I have every right to verify how my parcel was handled at each stage. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 5. Strong Red Flags Indicating Mishandling \n   \n Receiving: \n   \n Wrong items, \n   \n Missing items, \n   \n Incorrect delivery quantity, \n   \n   \n clearly indicates that: \n   \n The parcel was either mishandled during transit, \n or \n   \n Incorrectly sorted or packed, \n or \n   \n Misrouted at a particular hub, \n or \n   \n Tampered with or misplaced during the chain movement. \n   \n   \n Only a thorough multi-hub investigation can find the exact failure point. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 6. Immediate and Suitable Resolution Expected \n   \n Considering the severity of the issue, I expect PharmEasy to provide one of the following resolutions: \n   \n ✔ Option 1: Replacement \n   \n Provide all the correct medicines/products that I originally ordered. \n   \n ✔ Option 2: Full Refund \n   \n If replacement is not possible, initiate a complete refund for all missing and incorrect items. \n   \n A fair and customer-centric resolution is expected and required. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 7. Urgent Actions Required \n   \n Please proceed with: \n   \n 1. Reopening my complaint \n   \n   \n 2. Initiating a multi-hub chain-of-custody audit \n   \n   \n 3. Reviewing all hub CCTV footage \n   \n   \n 4. Verifying weight logs \n   \n   \n 5. Sharing relevant CCTV footage with me \n   \n   \n 6. Providing either replacement or refund \n   \n   \n 7. Ensuring accountability through internal teams \n   \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 8. Final Warning Before External Escalation \n   \n I want to state clearly, respectfully, and firmly: \n   \n If this complaint is again closed without: \n   \n A complete CCTV review, \n   \n A full chain-of-custody audit, \n   \n A transparent and justified resolution, \n   \n   \n I will be left with no choice but to escalate this matter further to: \n   \n PharmEasy Senior Executive Leadership \n   \n National Consumer Helpline (Government of India) \n   \n Consumer Court under Consumer Protection Act, 2019 \n   \n Relevant Pharmaceutical Regulatory Authorities \n   \n Any other legal body as applicable \n   \n   \n I hope PharmEasy will resolve the matter before such steps become necessary. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 9. Conclusion \n   \n PharmEasy is expected to maintain the highest standards of safety, accuracy, and transparency, especially when dealing with healthcare products. \n   \n All I seek is: \n   \n A complete and professional investigation \n   \n Transparent communication \n   \n A fair resolution (replacement or refund) \n   \n   \n I trust your team will handle this matter with the seriousness it deserves and respond urgently. \n   \n Warm regards, \n Rohan  \n   \n \n\n \n Disclaimer: \n This email contains proprietary, business-confidential, and/or privileged material.

Summary of the Issue – Missing and Wrong Medicines \n   \n I had ordered 5 medicines/products under the above-mentioned order ID. \n However, during delivery: \n   \n I received only 2 items, \n   \n And both items were wrong/incorrect medicines, \n   \n The remaining 3 items were completely missing. \n   \n   \n This is not a minor operational error. This is a serious breach of order integrity, especially in the pharmaceutical industry where accuracy directly affects customer health and safety. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 2. Incomplete and Procedurally Incorrect Investigation \n   \n I was informed that my complaint was closed because your team reviewed only the dispatch video and found no issue. \n   \n With due respect, I want to make it very clear that: \n   \n A dispatch-level video alone does NOT constitute a complete investigation. \n   \n A standard and fair investigation for missing or incorrect medicines must include: \n   \n Review of CCTV footage from all hubs \n   \n Transit-level verification of the parcel \n   \n Sorting-center camera checks \n   \n Detailed chain-of-custody tracking \n   \n Weight log comparison at every point \n   \n Verification of movement and scan logs \n   \n Delivery station handover footage \n   \n Re-bagging or re-routing investigation \n   \n   \n Closing a serious complaint based only on the dispatch video is operationally incomplete, logically insufficient, and professionally unacceptable. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 3. Request for Full Chain-of-Custody Investigation \n   \n I formally request PharmEasy to conduct a complete and transparent chain-of-custody investigation, including: \n   \n A. CCTV Footage Review (Mandatory) \n   \n You must review the CCTV footage of: \n   \n Packing center \n   \n First sorting warehouse \n   \n Every transit and routing hub \n   \n Regional processing centers \n   \n Final delivery hub \n   \n Delivery station sorting area \n   \n Pick-up and handover section \n   \n   \n B. Verification of Weight Logs \n   \n A detailed comparison of: \n   \n Initial package weight at the origin \n   \n Weight during each hub scan \n   \n Weight during re-bagging \n   \n Final delivery station weight \n   \n   \n Any mismatch will clearly show missing items. \n   \n C. Movement & Scan Audit \n   \n A full audit should include: \n   \n Outbound scan \n   \n Inbound scans at all hubs \n   \n Routing details \n   \n Sorting belt entries \n   \n Delivery executive pickup scan \n   \n Re-scan or re-routing logs \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 4. Request for Transparency – Provide Relevant CCTV Footage \n   \n Once the investigation is completed, I request that the relevant CCTV footage, including: \n   \n Packing \n   \n Sorting \n   \n Hub movement \n   \n Delivery station handling \n   \n   \n be shared with me for transparency, as I have every right to verify how my parcel was handled at each stage. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 5. Strong Red Flags Indicating Mishandling \n   \n Receiving: \n   \n Wrong items, \n   \n Missing items, \n   \n Incorrect delivery quantity, \n   \n   \n clearly indicates that: \n   \n The parcel was either mishandled during transit, \n or \n   \n Incorrectly sorted or packed, \n or \n   \n Misrouted at a particular hub, \n or \n   \n Tampered with or misplaced during the chain movement. \n   \n   \n Only a thorough multi-hub investigation can find the exact failure point. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 6. Immediate and Suitable Resolution Expected \n   \n Considering the severity of the issue, I expect PharmEasy to provide one of the following resolutions: \n   \n ✔ Option 1: Replacement \n   \n Provide all the correct medicines/products that I originally ordered. \n   \n ✔ Option 2: Full Refund \n   \n If replacement is not possible, initiate a complete refund for all missing and incorrect items. \n   \n A fair and customer-centric resolution is expected and required. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 7. Urgent Actions Required \n   \n Please proceed with: \n   \n 1. Reopening my complaint \n   \n   \n 2. Initiating a multi-hub chain-of-custody audit \n   \n   \n 3. Reviewing all hub CCTV footage \n   \n   \n 4. Verifying weight logs \n   \n   \n 5. Sharing relevant CCTV footage with me \n   \n   \n 6. Providing either replacement or refund \n   \n   \n 7. Ensuring accountability through internal teams \n   \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 8. Final Warning Before External Escalation \n   \n I want to state clearly, respectfully, and firmly: \n   \n If this complaint is again closed without: \n   \n A complete CCTV review, \n   \n A full chain-of-custody audit, \n   \n A transparent and justified resolution, \n   \n   \n I will be left with no choice but to escalate this matter further to: \n   \n PharmEasy Senior Executive Leadership \n   \n National Consumer Helpline (Government of India) \n   \n Consumer Court under Consumer Protection Act, 2019 \n   \n Relevant Pharmaceutical Regulatory Authorities \n   \n Any other legal body as applicable \n   \n   \n I hope PharmEasy will resolve the matter before such steps become necessary. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 9. Conclusion \n   \n PharmEasy is expected to maintain the highest standards of safety, accuracy, and transparency, especially when dealing with healthcare products. \n   \n All I seek is: \n   \n A complete and professional investigation \n   \n Transparent communication \n   \n A fair resolution (replacement or refund) \n   \n   \n I trust your team will handle this matter with the seriousness it deserves and respond urgently. \n   \n Warm regards, \n Rohan  \n   \n \n\n \n Disclaimer: \n This email contains proprietary, business-confidential, and/or privileged material.

Summary of the Issue – Missing and Wrong Medicines \n   \n I had ordered 5 medicines/products under the above-mentioned order ID. \n However, during delivery: \n   \n I received only 2 items, \n   \n And both items were wrong/incorrect medicines, \n   \n The remaining 3 items were completely missing. \n   \n   \n This is not a minor operational error. This is a serious breach of order integrity, especially in the pharmaceutical industry where accuracy directly affects customer health and safety. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 2. Incomplete and Procedurally Incorrect Investigation \n   \n I was informed that my complaint was closed because your team reviewed only the dispatch video and found no issue. \n   \n With due respect, I want to make it very clear that: \n   \n A dispatch-level video alone does NOT constitute a complete investigation. \n   \n A standard and fair investigation for missing or incorrect medicines must include: \n   \n Review of CCTV footage from all hubs \n   \n Transit-level verification of the parcel \n   \n Sorting-center camera checks \n   \n Detailed chain-of-custody tracking \n   \n Weight log comparison at every point \n   \n Verification of movement and scan logs \n   \n Delivery station handover footage \n   \n Re-bagging or re-routing investigation \n   \n   \n Closing a serious complaint based only on the dispatch video is operationally incomplete, logically insufficient, and professionally unacceptable. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 3. Request for Full Chain-of-Custody Investigation \n   \n I formally request PharmEasy to conduct a complete and transparent chain-of-custody investigation, including: \n   \n A. CCTV Footage Review (Mandatory) \n   \n You must review the CCTV footage of: \n   \n Packing center \n   \n First sorting warehouse \n   \n Every transit and routing hub \n   \n Regional processing centers \n   \n Final delivery hub \n   \n Delivery station sorting area \n   \n Pick-up and handover section \n   \n   \n B. Verification of Weight Logs \n   \n A detailed comparison of: \n   \n Initial package weight at the origin \n   \n Weight during each hub scan \n   \n Weight during re-bagging \n   \n Final delivery station weight \n   \n   \n Any mismatch will clearly show missing items. \n   \n C. Movement & Scan Audit \n   \n A full audit should include: \n   \n Outbound scan \n   \n Inbound scans at all hubs \n   \n Routing details \n   \n Sorting belt entries \n   \n Delivery executive pickup scan \n   \n Re-scan or re-routing logs \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 4. Request for Transparency – Provide Relevant CCTV Footage \n   \n Once the investigation is completed, I request that the relevant CCTV footage, including: \n   \n Packing \n   \n Sorting \n   \n Hub movement \n   \n Delivery station handling \n   \n   \n be shared with me for transparency, as I have every right to verify how my parcel was handled at each stage. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 5. Strong Red Flags Indicating Mishandling \n   \n Receiving: \n   \n Wrong items, \n   \n Missing items, \n   \n Incorrect delivery quantity, \n   \n   \n clearly indicates that: \n   \n The parcel was either mishandled during transit, \n or \n   \n Incorrectly sorted or packed, \n or \n   \n Misrouted at a particular hub, \n or \n   \n Tampered with or misplaced during the chain movement. \n   \n   \n Only a thorough multi-hub investigation can find the exact failure point. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 6. Immediate and Suitable Resolution Expected \n   \n Considering the severity of the issue, I expect PharmEasy to provide one of the following resolutions: \n   \n ✔ Option 1: Replacement \n   \n Provide all the correct medicines/products that I originally ordered. \n   \n ✔ Option 2: Full Refund \n   \n If replacement is not possible, initiate a complete refund for all missing and incorrect items. \n   \n A fair and customer-centric resolution is expected and required. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 7. Urgent Actions Required \n   \n Please proceed with: \n   \n 1. Reopening my complaint \n   \n   \n 2. Initiating a multi-hub chain-of-custody audit \n   \n   \n 3. Reviewing all hub CCTV footage \n   \n   \n 4. Verifying weight logs \n   \n   \n 5. Sharing relevant CCTV footage with me \n   \n   \n 6. Providing either replacement or refund \n   \n   \n 7. Ensuring accountability through internal teams \n   \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 8. Final Warning Before External Escalation \n   \n I want to state clearly, respectfully, and firmly: \n   \n If this complaint is again closed without: \n   \n A complete CCTV review, \n   \n A full chain-of-custody audit, \n   \n A transparent and justified resolution, \n   \n   \n I will be left with no choice but to escalate this matter further to: \n   \n PharmEasy Senior Executive Leadership \n   \n National Consumer Helpline (Government of India) \n   \n Consumer Court under Consumer Protection Act, 2019 \n   \n Relevant Pharmaceutical Regulatory Authorities \n   \n Any other legal body as applicable \n   \n   \n I hope PharmEasy will resolve the matter before such steps become necessary. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 9. Conclusion \n   \n PharmEasy is expected to maintain the highest standards of safety, accuracy, and transparency, especially when dealing with healthcare products. \n   \n All I seek is: \n   \n A complete and professional investigation \n   \n Transparent communication \n   \n A fair resolution (replacement or refund) \n   \n   \n I trust your team will handle this matter with the seriousness it deserves and respond urgently. \n   \n Warm regards, \n Rohan  \n   \n \n\n \n Disclaimer: \n This email contains proprietary, business-confidential, and/or privileged material.

Summary of the Issue – Missing and Wrong Medicines \n   \n I had ordered 5 medicines/products under the above-mentioned order ID. \n However, during delivery: \n   \n I received only 2 items, \n   \n And both items were wrong/incorrect medicines, \n   \n The remaining 3 items were completely missing. \n   \n   \n This is not a minor operational error.

Strong Red Flags Indicating Mishandling \n   \n Receiving: \n   \n Wrong items, \n   \n Missing items, \n   \n Incorrect delivery quantity, \n   \n   \n clearly indicates that: \n   \n The parcel was either mishandled during transit, \n or \n   \n Incorrectly sorted or packed, \n or \n   \n Misrouted at a particular hub, \n or \n   \n Tampered with or misplaced during the chain movement. \n   \n   \n Only a thorough multi-hub investigation can find the exact failure point. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 6. Immediate and Suitable Resolution Expected \n   \n Considering the severity of the issue, I expect PharmEasy to provide one of the following resolutions: \n   \n ✔ Option 1: Replacement \n   \n Provide all the correct medicines/products that I originally ordered. \n   \n ✔ Option 2: Full Refund \n   \n If replacement is not possible, initiate a complete refund for all missing and incorrect items. \n   \n A fair and customer-centric resolution is expected and required. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 7.

Summary of the Issue – Missing and Wrong Medicines \n   \n I had ordered 5 medicines/products under the above-mentioned order ID. \n However, during delivery: \n   \n I received only 2 items, \n   \n And both items were wrong/incorrect medicines, \n   \n The remaining 3 items were completely missing. \n   \n   \n This is not a minor operational error. This is a serious breach of order integrity, especially in the pharmaceutical industry where accuracy directly affects customer health and safety. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 2. Incomplete and Procedurally Incorrect Investigation \n   \n I was informed that my complaint was closed because your team reviewed only the dispatch video and found no issue. \n   \n With due respect, I want to make it very clear that: \n   \n A dispatch-level video alone does NOT constitute a complete investigation. \n   \n A standard and fair investigation for missing or incorrect medicines must include: \n   \n Review of CCTV footage from all hubs \n   \n Transit-level verification of the parcel \n   \n Sorting-center camera checks \n   \n Detailed chain-of-custody tracking \n   \n Weight log comparison at every point \n   \n Verification of movement and scan logs \n   \n Delivery station handover footage \n   \n Re-bagging or re-routing investigation \n   \n   \n Closing a serious complaint based only on the dispatch video is operationally incomplete, logically insufficient, and professionally unacceptable. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 3. Request for Full Chain-of-Custody Investigation \n   \n I formally request PharmEasy to conduct a complete and transparent chain-of-custody investigation, including: \n   \n A. CCTV Footage Review (Mandatory) \n   \n You must review the CCTV footage of: \n   \n Packing center \n   \n First sorting warehouse \n   \n Every transit and routing hub \n   \n Regional processing centers \n   \n Final delivery hub \n   \n Delivery station sorting area \n   \n Pick-up and handover section \n   \n   \n B. Verification of Weight Logs \n   \n A detailed comparison of: \n   \n Initial package weight at the origin \n   \n Weight during each hub scan \n   \n Weight during re-bagging \n   \n Final delivery station weight \n   \n   \n Any mismatch will clearly show missing items. \n   \n C. Movement & Scan Audit \n   \n A full audit should include: \n   \n Outbound scan \n   \n Inbound scans at all hubs \n   \n Routing details \n   \n Sorting belt entries \n   \n Delivery executive pickup scan \n   \n Re-scan or re-routing logs \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 4. Request for Transparency – Provide Relevant CCTV Footage \n   \n Once the investigation is completed, I request that the relevant CCTV footage, including: \n   \n Packing \n   \n Sorting \n   \n Hub movement \n   \n Delivery station handling \n   \n   \n be shared with me for transparency, as I have every right to verify how my parcel was handled at each stage. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 5. Strong Red Flags Indicating Mishandling \n   \n Receiving: \n   \n Wrong items, \n   \n Missing items, \n   \n Incorrect delivery quantity, \n   \n   \n clearly indicates that: \n   \n The parcel was either mishandled during transit, \n or \n   \n Incorrectly sorted or packed, \n or \n   \n Misrouted at a particular hub, \n or \n   \n Tampered with or misplaced during the chain movement. \n   \n   \n Only a thorough multi-hub investigation can find the exact failure point. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 6. Immediate and Suitable Resolution Expected \n   \n Considering the severity of the issue, I expect PharmEasy to provide one of the following resolutions: \n   \n ✔ Option 1: Replacement \n   \n Provide all the correct medicines/products that I originally ordered. \n   \n ✔ Option 2: Full Refund \n   \n If replacement is not possible, initiate a complete refund for all missing and incorrect items. \n   \n A fair and customer-centric resolution is expected and required. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 7. Urgent Actions Required \n   \n Please proceed with: \n   \n 1. Reopening my complaint \n   \n   \n 2. Initiating a multi-hub chain-of-custody audit \n   \n   \n 3. Reviewing all hub CCTV footage \n   \n   \n 4. Verifying weight logs \n   \n   \n 5. Sharing relevant CCTV footage with me \n   \n   \n 6. Providing either replacement or refund \n   \n   \n 7. Ensuring accountability through internal teams \n   \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 8. Final Warning Before External Escalation \n   \n I want to state clearly, respectfully, and firmly: \n   \n If this complaint is again closed without: \n   \n A complete CCTV review, \n   \n A full chain-of-custody audit, \n   \n A transparent and justified resolution, \n   \n   \n I will be left with no choice but to escalate this matter further to: \n   \n PharmEasy Senior Executive Leadership \n   \n National Consumer Helpline (Government of India) \n   \n Consumer Court under Consumer Protection Act, 2019 \n   \n Relevant Pharmaceutical Regulatory Authorities \n   \n Any other legal body as applicable \n   \n   \n I hope PharmEasy will resolve the matter before such steps become necessary. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 9. Conclusion \n   \n PharmEasy is expected to maintain the highest standards of safety, accuracy, and transparency, especially when dealing with healthcare products. \n   \n All I seek is: \n   \n A complete and professional investigation \n   \n Transparent communication \n   \n A fair resolution (replacement or refund) \n   \n   \n I trust your team will handle this matter with the seriousness it deserves and respond urgently. \n   \n Warm regards, \n Rohan  \n   \n \n\n \n Disclaimer: \n This email contains proprietary, business-confidential, and/or privileged material.

Summary of the Issue – Missing and Wrong Medicines \n   \n I had ordered 5 medicines/products under the above-mentioned order ID. \n However, during delivery: \n   \n I received only 2 items, \n   \n And both items were wrong/incorrect medicines, \n   \n The remaining 3 items were completely missing. \n   \n   \n This is not a minor operational error. This is a serious breach of order integrity, especially in the pharmaceutical industry where accuracy directly affects customer health and safety. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 2. Incomplete and Procedurally Incorrect Investigation \n   \n I was informed that my complaint was closed because your team reviewed only the dispatch video and found no issue. \n   \n With due respect, I want to make it very clear that: \n   \n A dispatch-level video alone does NOT constitute a complete investigation. \n   \n A standard and fair investigation for missing or incorrect medicines must include: \n   \n Review of CCTV footage from all hubs \n   \n Transit-level verification of the parcel \n   \n Sorting-center camera checks \n   \n Detailed chain-of-custody tracking \n   \n Weight log comparison at every point \n   \n Verification of movement and scan logs \n   \n Delivery station handover footage \n   \n Re-bagging or re-routing investigation \n   \n   \n Closing a serious complaint based only on the dispatch video is operationally incomplete, logically insufficient, and professionally unacceptable. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 3. Request for Full Chain-of-Custody Investigation \n   \n I formally request PharmEasy to conduct a complete and transparent chain-of-custody investigation, including: \n   \n A. CCTV Footage Review (Mandatory) \n   \n You must review the CCTV footage of: \n   \n Packing center \n   \n First sorting warehouse \n   \n Every transit and routing hub \n   \n Regional processing centers \n   \n Final delivery hub \n   \n Delivery station sorting area \n   \n Pick-up and handover section \n   \n   \n B. Verification of Weight Logs \n   \n A detailed comparison of: \n   \n Initial package weight at the origin \n   \n Weight during each hub scan \n   \n Weight during re-bagging \n   \n Final delivery station weight \n   \n   \n Any mismatch will clearly show missing items. \n   \n C. Movement & Scan Audit \n   \n A full audit should include: \n   \n Outbound scan \n   \n Inbound scans at all hubs \n   \n Routing details \n   \n Sorting belt entries \n   \n Delivery executive pickup scan \n   \n Re-scan or re-routing logs \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 4. Request for Transparency – Provide Relevant CCTV Footage \n   \n Once the investigation is completed, I request that the relevant CCTV footage, including: \n   \n Packing \n   \n Sorting \n   \n Hub movement \n   \n Delivery station handling \n   \n   \n be shared with me for transparency, as I have every right to verify how my parcel was handled at each stage. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 5. Strong Red Flags Indicating Mishandling \n   \n Receiving: \n   \n Wrong items, \n   \n Missing items, \n   \n Incorrect delivery quantity, \n   \n   \n clearly indicates that: \n   \n The parcel was either mishandled during transit, \n or \n   \n Incorrectly sorted or packed, \n or \n   \n Misrouted at a particular hub, \n or \n   \n Tampered with or misplaced during the chain movement. \n   \n   \n Only a thorough multi-hub investigation can find the exact failure point. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 6. Immediate and Suitable Resolution Expected \n   \n Considering the severity of the issue, I expect PharmEasy to provide one of the following resolutions: \n   \n ✔ Option 1: Replacement \n   \n Provide all the correct medicines/products that I originally ordered. \n   \n ✔ Option 2: Full Refund \n   \n If replacement is not possible, initiate a complete refund for all missing and incorrect items. \n   \n A fair and customer-centric resolution is expected and required. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 7. Urgent Actions Required \n   \n Please proceed with: \n   \n 1. Reopening my complaint \n   \n   \n 2. Initiating a multi-hub chain-of-custody audit \n   \n   \n 3. Reviewing all hub CCTV footage \n   \n   \n 4. Verifying weight logs \n   \n   \n 5. Sharing relevant CCTV footage with me \n   \n   \n 6. Providing either replacement or refund \n   \n   \n 7. Ensuring accountability through internal teams \n   \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 8. Final Warning Before External Escalation \n   \n I want to state clearly, respectfully, and firmly: \n   \n If this complaint is again closed without: \n   \n A complete CCTV review, \n   \n A full chain-of-custody audit, \n   \n A transparent and justified resolution, \n   \n   \n I will be left with no choice but to escalate this matter further to: \n   \n PharmEasy Senior Executive Leadership \n   \n National Consumer Helpline (Government of India) \n   \n Consumer Court under Consumer Protection Act, 2019 \n   \n Relevant Pharmaceutical Regulatory Authorities \n   \n Any other legal body as applicable \n   \n   \n I hope PharmEasy will resolve the matter before such steps become necessary. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 9. Conclusion \n   \n PharmEasy is expected to maintain the highest standards of safety, accuracy, and transparency, especially when dealing with healthcare products. \n   \n All I seek is: \n   \n A complete and professional investigation \n   \n Transparent communication \n   \n A fair resolution (replacement or refund) \n   \n   \n I trust your team will handle this matter with the seriousness it deserves and respond urgently. \n   \n Warm regards, \n Rohan  \n   \n \n\n \n Disclaimer: \n This email contains proprietary, business-confidential, and/or privileged material.

Summary of the Issue – Missing and Wrong Medicines \n   \n I had ordered 5 medicines/products under the above-mentioned order ID. \n However, during delivery: \n   \n I received only 2 items, \n   \n And both items were wrong/incorrect medicines, \n   \n The remaining 3 items were completely missing. \n   \n   \n This is not a minor operational error. This is a serious breach of order integrity, especially in the pharmaceutical industry where accuracy directly affects customer health and safety. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 2. Incomplete and Procedurally Incorrect Investigation \n   \n I was informed that my complaint was closed because your team reviewed only the dispatch video and found no issue. \n   \n With due respect, I want to make it very clear that: \n   \n A dispatch-level video alone does NOT constitute a complete investigation. \n   \n A standard and fair investigation for missing or incorrect medicines must include: \n   \n Review of CCTV footage from all hubs \n   \n Transit-level verification of the parcel \n   \n Sorting-center camera checks \n   \n Detailed chain-of-custody tracking \n   \n Weight log comparison at every point \n   \n Verification of movement and scan logs \n   \n Delivery station handover footage \n   \n Re-bagging or re-routing investigation \n   \n   \n Closing a serious complaint based only on the dispatch video is operationally incomplete, logically insufficient, and professionally unacceptable. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 3. Request for Full Chain-of-Custody Investigation \n   \n I formally request PharmEasy to conduct a complete and transparent chain-of-custody investigation, including: \n   \n A. CCTV Footage Review (Mandatory) \n   \n You must review the CCTV footage of: \n   \n Packing center \n   \n First sorting warehouse \n   \n Every transit and routing hub \n   \n Regional processing centers \n   \n Final delivery hub \n   \n Delivery station sorting area \n   \n Pick-up and handover section \n   \n   \n B. Verification of Weight Logs \n   \n A detailed comparison of: \n   \n Initial package weight at the origin \n   \n Weight during each hub scan \n   \n Weight during re-bagging \n   \n Final delivery station weight \n   \n   \n Any mismatch will clearly show missing items. \n   \n C. Movement & Scan Audit \n   \n A full audit should include: \n   \n Outbound scan \n   \n Inbound scans at all hubs \n   \n Routing details \n   \n Sorting belt entries \n   \n Delivery executive pickup scan \n   \n Re-scan or re-routing logs \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 4. Request for Transparency – Provide Relevant CCTV Footage \n   \n Once the investigation is completed, I request that the relevant CCTV footage, including: \n   \n Packing \n   \n Sorting \n   \n Hub movement \n   \n Delivery station handling \n   \n   \n be shared with me for transparency, as I have every right to verify how my parcel was handled at each stage. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 5. Strong Red Flags Indicating Mishandling \n   \n Receiving: \n   \n Wrong items, \n   \n Missing items, \n   \n Incorrect delivery quantity, \n   \n   \n clearly indicates that: \n   \n The parcel was either mishandled during transit, \n or \n   \n Incorrectly sorted or packed, \n or \n   \n Misrouted at a particular hub, \n or \n   \n Tampered with or misplaced during the chain movement. \n   \n   \n Only a thorough multi-hub investigation can find the exact failure point. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 6. Immediate and Suitable Resolution Expected \n   \n Considering the severity of the issue, I expect PharmEasy to provide one of the following resolutions: \n   \n ✔ Option 1: Replacement \n   \n Provide all the correct medicines/products that I originally ordered. \n   \n ✔ Option 2: Full Refund \n   \n If replacement is not possible, initiate a complete refund for all missing and incorrect items. \n   \n A fair and customer-centric resolution is expected and required. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 7. Urgent Actions Required \n   \n Please proceed with: \n   \n 1. Reopening my complaint \n   \n   \n 2. Initiating a multi-hub chain-of-custody audit \n   \n   \n 3. Reviewing all hub CCTV footage \n   \n   \n 4. Verifying weight logs \n   \n   \n 5. Sharing relevant CCTV footage with me \n   \n   \n 6. Providing either replacement or refund \n   \n   \n 7. Ensuring accountability through internal teams \n   \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 8. Final Warning Before External Escalation \n   \n I want to state clearly, respectfully, and firmly: \n   \n If this complaint is again closed without: \n   \n A complete CCTV review, \n   \n A full chain-of-custody audit, \n   \n A transparent and justified resolution, \n   \n   \n I will be left with no choice but to escalate this matter further to: \n   \n PharmEasy Senior Executive Leadership \n   \n National Consumer Helpline (Government of India) \n   \n Consumer Court under Consumer Protection Act, 2019 \n   \n Relevant Pharmaceutical Regulatory Authorities \n   \n Any other legal body as applicable \n   \n   \n I hope PharmEasy will resolve the matter before such steps become necessary. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 9. Conclusion \n   \n PharmEasy is expected to maintain the highest standards of safety, accuracy, and transparency, especially when dealing with healthcare products. \n   \n All I seek is: \n   \n A complete and professional investigation \n   \n Transparent communication \n   \n A fair resolution (replacement or refund) \n   \n   \n I trust your team will handle this matter with the seriousness it deserves and respond urgently. \n   \n Warm regards, \n Rohan  \n   \n \n\n \n Disclaimer: \n This email contains proprietary, business-confidential, and/or privileged material.

Summary of the Issue – Missing and Wrong Medicines \n   \n I had ordered 5 medicines/products under the above-mentioned order ID. \n However, during delivery: \n   \n I received only 2 items, \n   \n And both items were wrong/incorrect medicines, \n   \n The remaining 3 items were completely missing. \n   \n   \n This is not a minor operational error. This is a serious breach of order integrity, especially in the pharmaceutical industry where accuracy directly affects customer health and safety. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 2. Incomplete and Procedurally Incorrect Investigation \n   \n I was informed that my complaint was closed because your team reviewed only the dispatch video and found no issue. \n   \n With due respect, I want to make it very clear that: \n   \n A dispatch-level video alone does NOT constitute a complete investigation. \n   \n A standard and fair investigation for missing or incorrect medicines must include: \n   \n Review of CCTV footage from all hubs \n   \n Transit-level verification of the parcel \n   \n Sorting-center camera checks \n   \n Detailed chain-of-custody tracking \n   \n Weight log comparison at every point \n   \n Verification of movement and scan logs \n   \n Delivery station handover footage \n   \n Re-bagging or re-routing investigation \n   \n   \n Closing a serious complaint based only on the dispatch video is operationally incomplete, logically insufficient, and professionally unacceptable. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 3. Request for Full Chain-of-Custody Investigation \n   \n I formally request PharmEasy to conduct a complete and transparent chain-of-custody investigation, including: \n   \n A. CCTV Footage Review (Mandatory) \n   \n You must review the CCTV footage of: \n   \n Packing center \n   \n First sorting warehouse \n   \n Every transit and routing hub \n   \n Regional processing centers \n   \n Final delivery hub \n   \n Delivery station sorting area \n   \n Pick-up and handover section \n   \n   \n B. Verification of Weight Logs \n   \n A detailed comparison of: \n   \n Initial package weight at the origin \n   \n Weight during each hub scan \n   \n Weight during re-bagging \n   \n Final delivery station weight \n   \n   \n Any mismatch will clearly show missing items. \n   \n C. Movement & Scan Audit \n   \n A full audit should include: \n   \n Outbound scan \n   \n Inbound scans at all hubs \n   \n Routing details \n   \n Sorting belt entries \n   \n Delivery executive pickup scan \n   \n Re-scan or re-routing logs \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 4. Request for Transparency – Provide Relevant CCTV Footage \n   \n Once the investigation is completed, I request that the relevant CCTV footage, including: \n   \n Packing \n   \n Sorting \n   \n Hub movement \n   \n Delivery station handling \n   \n   \n be shared with me for transparency, as I have every right to verify how my parcel was handled at each stage. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 5. Strong Red Flags Indicating Mishandling \n   \n Receiving: \n   \n Wrong items, \n   \n Missing items, \n   \n Incorrect delivery quantity, \n   \n   \n clearly indicates that: \n   \n The parcel was either mishandled during transit, \n or \n   \n Incorrectly sorted or packed, \n or \n   \n Misrouted at a particular hub, \n or \n   \n Tampered with or misplaced during the chain movement. \n   \n   \n Only a thorough multi-hub investigation can find the exact failure point. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 6. Immediate and Suitable Resolution Expected \n   \n Considering the severity of the issue, I expect PharmEasy to provide one of the following resolutions: \n   \n ✔ Option 1: Replacement \n   \n Provide all the correct medicines/products that I originally ordered. \n   \n ✔ Option 2: Full Refund \n   \n If replacement is not possible, initiate a complete refund for all missing and incorrect items. \n   \n A fair and customer-centric resolution is expected and required. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 7. Urgent Actions Required \n   \n Please proceed with: \n   \n 1. Reopening my complaint \n   \n   \n 2. Initiating a multi-hub chain-of-custody audit \n   \n   \n 3. Reviewing all hub CCTV footage \n   \n   \n 4. Verifying weight logs \n   \n   \n 5. Sharing relevant CCTV footage with me \n   \n   \n 6. Providing either replacement or refund \n   \n   \n 7. Ensuring accountability through internal teams \n   \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 8. Final Warning Before External Escalation \n   \n I want to state clearly, respectfully, and firmly: \n   \n If this complaint is again closed without: \n   \n A complete CCTV review, \n   \n A full chain-of-custody audit, \n   \n A transparent and justified resolution, \n   \n   \n I will be left with no choice but to escalate this matter further to: \n   \n PharmEasy Senior Executive Leadership \n   \n National Consumer Helpline (Government of India) \n   \n Consumer Court under Consumer Protection Act, 2019 \n   \n Relevant Pharmaceutical Regulatory Authorities \n   \n Any other legal body as applicable \n   \n   \n I hope PharmEasy will resolve the matter before such steps become necessary. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 9. Conclusion \n   \n PharmEasy is expected to maintain the highest standards of safety, accuracy, and transparency, especially when dealing with healthcare products. \n   \n All I seek is: \n   \n A complete and professional investigation \n   \n Transparent communication \n   \n A fair resolution (replacement or refund) \n   \n   \n I trust your team will handle this matter with the seriousness it deserves and respond urgently. \n   \n Warm regards, \n Rohan  \n   \n \n\n \n Disclaimer: \n This email contains proprietary, business-confidential, and/or privileged material.

Summary of the Issue – Missing and Wrong Medicines \n   \n I had ordered 5 medicines/products under this order ID. \n   \n However, during delivery: \n   \n I received only 2 items \n   \n Both items were wrong/incorrect medicines \n   \n The remaining 3 items were completely missing \n   \n   \n This is not a minor operational error. In the pharmaceutical industry, such mistakes are a serious breach of safety and accuracy, directly affecting customer health and safety. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 2. Incomplete and Procedurally Incorrect Investigation \n   \n I was informed that my complaint was closed after reviewing only the dispatch video. \n   \n With due respect, I must state clearly: \n   \n A dispatch-level video alone is NOT a complete investigation. \n   \n A proper investigation requires: \n   \n CCTV footage from all hubs \n   \n Transit-level verification of the parcel \n   \n Sorting-center camera checks \n   \n Full chain-of-custody tracking \n   \n Weight log comparisons at every stage \n   \n Delivery station handover footage \n   \n Re-bagging and re-routing checks \n   \n Complete audit of all scan and movement logs \n   \n   \n Closing a serious medicine-related complaint solely based on the dispatch video is operationally incomplete, logically insufficient, and professionally unacceptable. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 3. Request for Full Chain-of-Custody Investigation \n   \n I formally request a complete and transparent multi-hub investigation, including: \n   \n A. CCTV Footage Review (Mandatory) \n   \n Footage from: \n   \n Packing center \n   \n First sorting warehouse \n   \n All transit and routing hubs \n   \n Regional processing centers \n   \n Final delivery hub \n   \n Delivery station sorting & handover area \n   \n   \n B. Verification of Weight Logs \n   \n Detailed comparison of: \n   \n Initial package weight at origin \n   \n Weight at each hub scan \n   \n Weight during re-bagging \n   \n Final delivery station weight \n   \n   \n C. Movement & Scan Audit \n   \n Full audit of: \n   \n Outbound scans \n   \n Inbound scans at all hubs \n   \n Routing details \n   \n Sorting belt entries \n   \n Delivery executive pickup scans \n   \n Re-scan and re-routing logs \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 4. Transparency – Share Relevant CCTV Footage \n   \n Once the investigation is completed, I request that all relevant CCTV footage, including packing, sorting, hub movement, and delivery station handling, be shared with me for transparency. I have the full right to verify how my parcel was handled at every stage. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 5. Strong Red Flags Indicating Mishandling \n   \n Receiving wrong items, missing items, and incorrect quantity clearly indicates: \n   \n Parcel mishandling during transit \n   \n Incorrect sorting or packing \n   \n Misrouting at a hub \n   \n Tampering or misplacement \n   \n   \n Only a multi-hub, multi-stage investigation can identify the exact point of failure. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 6. Immediate and Suitable Resolution Expected \n   \n Given the seriousness of this issue, I expect one of the following resolutions immediately: \n   \n ✔ Option 1: Replacement – Provide all the correct medicines/products originally ordered \n OR \n ✔ Option 2: Full Refund – For all missing and incorrect items \n   \n A fair, customer-centric resolution is mandatory. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 7. Urgent Actions Required \n   \n Please proceed with: \n   \n 1. Reopening my complaint \n   \n   \n 2. Conducting a multi-hub chain-of-custody audit \n   \n   \n 3. Reviewing all relevant CCTV footage \n   \n   \n 4. Verifying weight logs and scan logs \n   \n   \n 5. Sharing relevant CCTV footage with me \n   \n   \n 6. Providing replacement or refund \n   \n   \n 7. Ensuring accountability across internal teams \n   \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 8. Final Warning Before External Escalation \n   \n If this complaint is again closed without: \n   \n Complete CCTV review \n   \n Proper multi-hub investigation \n   \n Transparent, justified resolution \n   \n   \n I will escalate the matter to: \n   \n PharmEasy Senior Executive Leadership \n   \n National Consumer Helpline (Government of India) \n   \n Consumer Court under Consumer Protection Act, 2019 \n   \n Relevant pharmaceutical regulatory authorities \n   \n Any other legal forum as applicable \n   \n   \n I hope PharmEasy resolves this matter immediately before external escalation becomes necessary. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 9. Conclusion \n   \n PharmEasy is expected to maintain the highest standards of: \n   \n Accuracy \n   \n Safety \n   \n Transparency \n   \n Operational integrity \n   \n   \n All I seek is: \n   \n A complete and professional investigation \n   \n Transparent communication \n   \n A fair resolution (replacement or refund) \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n Final Statement (as requested): \n   \n You have wasted more than 10 days of my time on this issue. I cannot allow any further delay. I expect a suitable resolution to be provided immediately — without any further delay. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n Warm regards, \n Rohan \n \n\n \n Disclaimer: \n This email contains proprietary, business-confidential, and/or privileged material.

Summary of the Issue – Missing and Wrong Medicines \n   \n I had ordered 5 medicines/products under this order ID. \n   \n However, during delivery: \n   \n I received only 2 items \n   \n Both items were wrong/incorrect medicines \n   \n The remaining 3 items were completely missing \n   \n   \n This is not a minor operational error. In the pharmaceutical industry, such mistakes are a serious breach of safety and accuracy, directly affecting customer health and safety. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 2. Incomplete and Procedurally Incorrect Investigation \n   \n I was informed that my complaint was closed after reviewing only the dispatch video. \n   \n With due respect, I must state clearly: \n   \n A dispatch-level video alone is NOT a complete investigation. \n   \n A proper investigation requires: \n   \n CCTV footage from all hubs \n   \n Transit-level verification of the parcel \n   \n Sorting-center camera checks \n   \n Full chain-of-custody tracking \n   \n Weight log comparisons at every stage \n   \n Delivery station handover footage \n   \n Re-bagging and re-routing checks \n   \n Complete audit of all scan and movement logs \n   \n   \n Closing a serious medicine-related complaint solely based on the dispatch video is operationally incomplete, logically insufficient, and professionally unacceptable. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 3. Request for Full Chain-of-Custody Investigation \n   \n I formally request a complete and transparent multi-hub investigation, including: \n   \n A. CCTV Footage Review (Mandatory) \n   \n Footage from: \n   \n Packing center \n   \n First sorting warehouse \n   \n All transit and routing hubs \n   \n Regional processing centers \n   \n Final delivery hub \n   \n Delivery station sorting & handover area \n   \n   \n B. Verification of Weight Logs \n   \n Detailed comparison of: \n   \n Initial package weight at origin \n   \n Weight at each hub scan \n   \n Weight during re-bagging \n   \n Final delivery station weight \n   \n   \n C. Movement & Scan Audit \n   \n Full audit of: \n   \n Outbound scans \n   \n Inbound scans at all hubs \n   \n Routing details \n   \n Sorting belt entries \n   \n Delivery executive pickup scans \n   \n Re-scan and re-routing logs \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 4. Transparency – Share Relevant CCTV Footage \n   \n Once the investigation is completed, I request that all relevant CCTV footage, including packing, sorting, hub movement, and delivery station handling, be shared with me for transparency. I have the full right to verify how my parcel was handled at every stage. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 5. Strong Red Flags Indicating Mishandling \n   \n Receiving wrong items, missing items, and incorrect quantity clearly indicates: \n   \n Parcel mishandling during transit \n   \n Incorrect sorting or packing \n   \n Misrouting at a hub \n   \n Tampering or misplacement \n   \n   \n Only a multi-hub, multi-stage investigation can identify the exact point of failure. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 6. Immediate and Suitable Resolution Expected \n   \n Given the seriousness of this issue, I expect one of the following resolutions immediately: \n   \n ✔ Option 1: Replacement – Provide all the correct medicines/products originally ordered \n OR \n ✔ Option 2: Full Refund – For all missing and incorrect items \n   \n A fair, customer-centric resolution is mandatory. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 7. Urgent Actions Required \n   \n Please proceed with: \n   \n 1. Reopening my complaint \n   \n   \n 2. Conducting a multi-hub chain-of-custody audit \n   \n   \n 3. Reviewing all relevant CCTV footage \n   \n   \n 4. Verifying weight logs and scan logs \n   \n   \n 5. Sharing relevant CCTV footage with me \n   \n   \n 6. Providing replacement or refund \n   \n   \n 7. Ensuring accountability across internal teams \n   \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 8. Final Warning Before External Escalation \n   \n If this complaint is again closed without: \n   \n Complete CCTV review \n   \n Proper multi-hub investigation \n   \n Transparent, justified resolution \n   \n   \n I will escalate the matter to: \n   \n PharmEasy Senior Executive Leadership \n   \n National Consumer Helpline (Government of India) \n   \n Consumer Court under Consumer Protection Act, 2019 \n   \n Relevant pharmaceutical regulatory authorities \n   \n Any other legal forum as applicable \n   \n   \n I hope PharmEasy resolves this matter immediately before external escalation becomes necessary. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 9. Conclusion \n   \n PharmEasy is expected to maintain the highest standards of: \n   \n Accuracy \n   \n Safety \n   \n Transparency \n   \n Operational integrity \n   \n   \n All I seek is: \n   \n A complete and professional investigation \n   \n Transparent communication \n   \n A fair resolution (replacement or refund) \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n Final Statement (as requested): \n   \n You have wasted more than 10 days of my time on this issue. I cannot allow any further delay. I expect a suitable resolution to be provided immediately — without any further delay. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n Warm regards, \n Rohan \n \n\n \n Disclaimer: \n This email contains proprietary, business-confidential, and/or privileged material.

Incomplete and Procedurally Incorrect Investigation \n   \n I was informed that my complaint was closed after reviewing only the dispatch video. \n   \n With due respect, I must state clearly: \n   \n A dispatch-level video alone is NOT a complete investigation. \n   \n A proper investigation requires: \n   \n CCTV footage from all hubs \n   \n Transit-level verification of the parcel \n   \n Sorting-center camera checks \n   \n Full chain-of-custody tracking \n   \n Weight log comparisons at every stage \n   \n Delivery station handover footage \n   \n Re-bagging and re-routing checks \n   \n Complete audit of all scan and movement logs \n   \n   \n Closing a serious medicine-related complaint solely based on the dispatch video is operationally incomplete, logically insufficient, and professionally unacceptable. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 3. Request for Full Chain-of-Custody Investigation \n   \n I formally request a complete and transparent multi-hub investigation, including: \n   \n A. CCTV Footage Review (Mandatory) \n   \n Footage from: \n   \n Packing center \n   \n First sorting warehouse \n   \n All transit and routing hubs \n   \n Regional processing centers \n   \n Final delivery hub \n   \n Delivery station sorting & handover area \n   \n   \n B. Verification of Weight Logs \n   \n Detailed comparison of: \n   \n Initial package weight at origin \n   \n Weight at each hub scan \n   \n Weight during re-bagging \n   \n Final delivery station weight \n   \n   \n C. Movement & Scan Audit \n   \n Full audit of: \n   \n Outbound scans \n   \n Inbound scans at all hubs \n   \n Routing details \n   \n Sorting belt entries \n   \n Delivery executive pickup scans \n   \n Re-scan and re-routing logs \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 4. Transparency – Share Relevant CCTV Footage \n   \n Once the investigation is completed, I request that all relevant CCTV footage, including packing, sorting, hub movement, and delivery station handling, be shared with me for transparency. I have the full right to verify how my parcel was handled at every stage. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 5. Strong Red Flags Indicating Mishandling \n   \n Receiving wrong items, missing items, and incorrect quantity clearly indicates: \n   \n Parcel mishandling during transit \n   \n Incorrect sorting or packing \n   \n Misrouting at a hub \n   \n Tampering or misplacement \n   \n   \n Only a multi-hub, multi-stage investigation can identify the exact point of failure. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 6. Immediate and Suitable Resolution Expected \n   \n Given the seriousness of this issue, I expect one of the following resolutions immediately: \n   \n ✔ Option 1: Replacement – Provide all the correct medicines/products originally ordered \n OR \n ✔ Option 2: Full Refund – For all missing and incorrect items \n   \n A fair, customer-centric resolution is mandatory. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 7. Urgent Actions Required \n   \n Please proceed with: \n   \n 1. Reopening my complaint \n   \n   \n 2. Conducting a multi-hub chain-of-custody audit \n   \n   \n 3. Reviewing all relevant CCTV footage \n   \n   \n 4. Verifying weight logs and scan logs \n   \n   \n 5. Sharing relevant CCTV footage with me \n   \n   \n 6. Providing replacement or refund \n   \n   \n 7. Ensuring accountability across internal teams \n   \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 8. Final Warning Before External Escalation \n   \n If this complaint is again closed without: \n   \n Complete CCTV review \n   \n Proper multi-hub investigation \n   \n Transparent, justified resolution \n   \n   \n I will escalate the matter to: \n   \n PharmEasy Senior Executive Leadership \n   \n National Consumer Helpline (Government of India) \n   \n Consumer Court under Consumer Protection Act, 2019 \n   \n Relevant pharmaceutical regulatory authorities \n   \n Any other legal forum as applicable \n   \n   \n I hope PharmEasy resolves this matter immediately before external escalation becomes necessary. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 9. Conclusion \n   \n PharmEasy is expected to maintain the highest standards of: \n   \n Accuracy \n   \n Safety \n   \n Transparency \n   \n Operational integrity \n   \n   \n All I seek is: \n   \n A complete and professional investigation \n   \n Transparent communication \n   \n A fair resolution (replacement or refund) \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n Final Statement (as requested): \n   \n You have wasted more than 10 days of my time on this issue. I cannot allow any further delay. I expect a suitable resolution to be provided immediately — without any further delay. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n Warm regards, \n Rohan \n \n\n \n Disclaimer: \n This email contains proprietary, business-confidential, and/or privileged material.

Summary of the Issue – Missing and Wrong Medicines \n   \n I had ordered 5 medicines/products under this order ID. \n   \n However, during delivery: \n   \n I received only 2 items \n   \n Both items were wrong/incorrect medicines \n   \n The remaining 3 items were completely missing \n   \n   \n This is not a minor operational error. In the pharmaceutical industry, such mistakes are a serious breach of safety and accuracy, directly affecting customer health and safety. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 2. Incomplete and Procedurally Incorrect Investigation \n   \n I was informed that my complaint was closed after reviewing only the dispatch video. \n   \n With due respect, I must state clearly: \n   \n A dispatch-level video alone is NOT a complete investigation. \n   \n A proper investigation requires: \n   \n CCTV footage from all hubs \n   \n Transit-level verification of the parcel \n   \n Sorting-center camera checks \n   \n Full chain-of-custody tracking \n   \n Weight log comparisons at every stage \n   \n Delivery station handover footage \n   \n Re-bagging and re-routing checks \n   \n Complete audit of all scan and movement logs \n   \n   \n Closing a serious medicine-related complaint solely based on the dispatch video is operationally incomplete, logically insufficient, and professionally unacceptable. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 3. Request for Full Chain-of-Custody Investigation \n   \n I formally request a complete and transparent multi-hub investigation, including: \n   \n A. CCTV Footage Review (Mandatory) \n   \n Footage from: \n   \n Packing center \n   \n First sorting warehouse \n   \n All transit and routing hubs \n   \n Regional processing centers \n   \n Final delivery hub \n   \n Delivery station sorting & handover area \n   \n   \n B. Verification of Weight Logs \n   \n Detailed comparison of: \n   \n Initial package weight at origin \n   \n Weight at each hub scan \n   \n Weight during re-bagging \n   \n Final delivery station weight \n   \n   \n C. Movement & Scan Audit \n   \n Full audit of: \n   \n Outbound scans \n   \n Inbound scans at all hubs \n   \n Routing details \n   \n Sorting belt entries \n   \n Delivery executive pickup scans \n   \n Re-scan and re-routing logs \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 4. Transparency – Share Relevant CCTV Footage \n   \n Once the investigation is completed, I request that all relevant CCTV footage, including packing, sorting, hub movement, and delivery station handling, be shared with me for transparency. I have the full right to verify how my parcel was handled at every stage. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 5. Strong Red Flags Indicating Mishandling \n   \n Receiving wrong items, missing items, and incorrect quantity clearly indicates: \n   \n Parcel mishandling during transit \n   \n Incorrect sorting or packing \n   \n Misrouting at a hub \n   \n Tampering or misplacement \n   \n   \n Only a multi-hub, multi-stage investigation can identify the exact point of failure. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 6. Immediate and Suitable Resolution Expected \n   \n Given the seriousness of this issue, I expect one of the following resolutions immediately: \n   \n ✔ Option 1: Replacement – Provide all the correct medicines/products originally ordered \n OR \n ✔ Option 2: Full Refund – For all missing and incorrect items \n   \n A fair, customer-centric resolution is mandatory. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 7. Urgent Actions Required \n   \n Please proceed with: \n   \n 1. Reopening my complaint \n   \n   \n 2. Conducting a multi-hub chain-of-custody audit \n   \n   \n 3. Reviewing all relevant CCTV footage \n   \n   \n 4. Verifying weight logs and scan logs \n   \n   \n 5. Sharing relevant CCTV footage with me \n   \n   \n 6. Providing replacement or refund \n   \n   \n 7. Ensuring accountability across internal teams \n   \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 8. Final Warning Before External Escalation \n   \n If this complaint is again closed without: \n   \n Complete CCTV review \n   \n Proper multi-hub investigation \n   \n Transparent, justified resolution \n   \n   \n I will escalate the matter to: \n   \n PharmEasy Senior Executive Leadership \n   \n National Consumer Helpline (Government of India) \n   \n Consumer Court under Consumer Protection Act, 2019 \n   \n Relevant pharmaceutical regulatory authorities \n   \n Any other legal forum as applicable \n   \n   \n I hope PharmEasy resolves this matter immediately before external escalation becomes necessary. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n 9. Conclusion \n   \n PharmEasy is expected to maintain the highest standards of: \n   \n Accuracy \n   \n Safety \n   \n Transparency \n   \n Operational integrity \n   \n   \n All I seek is: \n   \n A complete and professional investigation \n   \n Transparent communication \n   \n A fair resolution (replacement or refund) \n   \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n Final Statement (as requested): \n   \n You have wasted more than 10 days of my time on this issue. I cannot allow any further delay. I expect a suitable resolution to be provided immediately — without any further delay. \n   \n   \n --- \n   \n Warm regards, \n Rohan \n \n\n \n Disclaimer: \n This email contains proprietary, business-confidential, and/or privileged material.

Senior Management,\r\n\r\nI am writing this email as a FINAL, URGENT, and HIGH-PRIORITY ESCALATION\r\nregarding the severe mishandling and procedural lapses associated with my\r\norder Order ID: 653726198280949760.\r\n\r\nI request you to read this email completely and carefully, as every point\r\nmentioned below is critical and requires immediate senior-level attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n1. Summary of the Issue – Missing and Wrong Medicines\r\n\r\nI had ordered 5 medicines/products under the above-mentioned order ID.\r\nHowever, during delivery:\r\n\r\nI received only 2 items,\r\n\r\nAnd both items were wrong/incorrect medicines,\r\n\r\nThe remaining 3 items were completely missing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not a minor operational error. This is a serious breach of order\r\nintegrity, especially in the pharmaceutical industry where accuracy\r\ndirectly affects customer health and safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n2. Incomplete and Procedurally Incorrect Investigation\r\n\r\nI was informed that my complaint was closed because your team reviewed only\r\nthe dispatch video and found no issue.\r\n\r\nWith due respect, I want to make it very clear that:\r\n\r\nA dispatch-level video alone does NOT constitute a complete investigation.\r\n\r\nA standard and fair investigation for missing or incorrect medicines must\r\ninclude:\r\n\r\nReview of CCTV footage from all hubs\r\n\r\nTransit-level verification of the parcel\r\n\r\nSorting-center camera checks\r\n\r\nDetailed chain-of-custody tracking\r\n\r\nWeight log comparison at every point\r\n\r\nVerification of movement and scan logs\r\n\r\nDelivery station handover footage\r\n\r\nRe-bagging or re-routing investigation\r\n\r\n\r\nClosing a serious complaint based only on the dispatch video is\r\noperationally incomplete, logically insufficient, and professionally\r\nunacceptable.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n3. Request for Full Chain-of-Custody Investigation\r\n\r\nI formally request PharmEasy to conduct a complete and transparent\r\nchain-of-custody investigation, including:\r\n\r\nA. CCTV Footage Review (Mandatory)\r\n\r\nYou must review the CCTV footage of:\r\n\r\nPacking center\r\n\r\nFirst sorting warehouse\r\n\r\nEvery transit and routing hub\r\n\r\nRegional processing centers\r\n\r\nFinal delivery hub\r\n\r\nDelivery station sorting area\r\n\r\nPick-up and handover section\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Verification of Weight Logs\r\n\r\nA detailed comparison of:\r\n\r\nInitial package weight at the origin\r\n\r\nWeight during each hub scan\r\n\r\nWeight during re-bagging\r\n\r\nFinal delivery station weight\r\n\r\n\r\nAny mismatch will clearly show missing items.\r\n\r\nC. Movement & Scan Audit\r\n\r\nA full audit should include:\r\n\r\nOutbound scan\r\n\r\nInbound scans at all hubs\r\n\r\nRouting details\r\n\r\nSorting belt entries\r\n\r\nDelivery executive pickup scan\r\n\r\nRe-scan or re-routing logs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n4.

Urgent Actions Required\r\n\r\nPlease proceed with:\r\n\r\n1. Reopening my complaint\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Initiating a multi-hub chain-of-custody audit\r\n\r\n\r\n3.

PharmEasy Customer Support Team,\r\nGrievance Redressal Department,\r\nand Senior Management,\r\n\r\nI am writing this email as a FINAL, URGENT, and HIGH-PRIORITY ESCALATION\r\nregarding the severe mishandling and procedural lapses associated with my\r\norder Order ID: 653726198280949760.\r\n\r\nI request you to read this email completely and carefully, as every point\r\nmentioned below is critical and requires immediate senior-level attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n1. Summary of the Issue – Missing and Wrong Medicines\r\n\r\nI had ordered 5 medicines/products under the above-mentioned order ID.\r\nHowever, during delivery:\r\n\r\nI received only 2 items,\r\n\r\nAnd both items were wrong/incorrect medicines,\r\n\r\nThe remaining 3 items were completely missing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not a minor operational error. This is a serious breach of order\r\nintegrity, especially in the pharmaceutical industry where accuracy\r\ndirectly affects customer health and safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n2. Incomplete and Procedurally Incorrect Investigation\r\n\r\nI was informed that my complaint was closed because your team reviewed only\r\nthe dispatch video and found no issue.\r\n\r\nWith due respect, I want to make it very clear that:\r\n\r\nA dispatch-level video alone does NOT constitute a complete investigation.\r\n\r\nA standard and fair investigation for missing or incorrect medicines must\r\ninclude:\r\n\r\nReview of CCTV footage from all hubs\r\n\r\nTransit-level verification of the parcel\r\n\r\nSorting-center camera checks\r\n\r\nDetailed chain-of-custody tracking\r\n\r\nWeight log comparison at every point\r\n\r\nVerification of movement and scan logs\r\n\r\nDelivery station handover footage\r\n\r\nRe-bagging or re-routing investigation\r\n\r\n\r\nClosing a serious complaint based only on the dispatch video is\r\noperationally incomplete, logically insufficient, and professionally\r\nunacceptable.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n3. Request for Full Chain-of-Custody Investigation\r\n\r\nI formally request PharmEasy to conduct a complete and transparent\r\nchain-of-custody investigation, including:\r\n\r\nA. CCTV Footage Review (Mandatory)\r\n\r\nYou must review the CCTV footage of:\r\n\r\nPacking center\r\n\r\nFirst sorting warehouse\r\n\r\nEvery transit and routing hub\r\n\r\nRegional processing centers\r\n\r\nFinal delivery hub\r\n\r\nDelivery station sorting area\r\n\r\nPick-up and handover section\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Verification of Weight Logs\r\n\r\nA detailed comparison of:\r\n\r\nInitial package weight at the origin\r\n\r\nWeight during each hub scan\r\n\r\nWeight during re-bagging\r\n\r\nFinal delivery station weight\r\n\r\n\r\nAny mismatch will clearly show missing items.\r\n\r\nC. Movement & Scan Audit\r\n\r\nA full audit should include:\r\n\r\nOutbound scan\r\n\r\nInbound scans at all hubs\r\n\r\nRouting details\r\n\r\nSorting belt entries\r\n\r\nDelivery executive pickup scan\r\n\r\nRe-scan or re-routing logs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n4. Request for Transparency – Provide Relevant CCTV Footage\r\n\r\nOnce the investigation is completed, I request that the relevant CCTV\r\nfootage, including:\r\n\r\nPacking\r\n\r\nSorting\r\n\r\nHub movement\r\n\r\nDelivery station handling\r\n\r\n\r\nbe shared with me for transparency, as I have every right to verify how my\r\nparcel was handled at each stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n5. Strong Red Flags Indicating Mishandling\r\n\r\nReceiving:\r\n\r\nWrong items,\r\n\r\nMissing items,\r\n\r\nIncorrect delivery quantity,\r\n\r\n\r\nclearly indicates that:\r\n\r\nThe parcel was either mishandled during transit,\r\nor\r\n\r\nIncorrectly sorted or packed,\r\nor\r\n\r\nMisrouted at a particular hub,\r\nor\r\n\r\nTampered with or misplaced during the chain movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly a thorough multi-hub investigation can find the exact failure point.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n6. Immediate and Suitable Resolution Expected\r\n\r\nConsidering the severity of the issue, I expect PharmEasy to provide one of\r\nthe following resolutions:\r\n\r\n✔ Option 1: Replacement\r\n\r\nProvide all the correct medicines/products that I originally ordered.\r\n\r\n✔ Option 2: Full Refund\r\n\r\nIf replacement is not possible, initiate a complete refund for all missing\r\nand incorrect items.\r\n\r\nA fair and customer-centric resolution is expected and required.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n7. Urgent Actions Required\r\n\r\nPlease proceed with:\r\n\r\n1. Reopening my complaint\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Initiating a multi-hub chain-of-custody audit\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Reviewing all hub CCTV footage\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Verifying weight logs\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Sharing relevant CCTV footage with me\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Providing either replacement or refund\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Ensuring accountability through internal teams\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n8. Final Warning Before External Escalation\r\n\r\nI want to state clearly, respectfully, and firmly:\r\n\r\nIf this complaint is again closed without:\r\n\r\nA complete CCTV review,\r\n\r\nA full chain-of-custody audit,\r\n\r\nA transparent and justified resolution,\r\n\r\n\r\nI will be left with no choice but to escalate this matter further to:\r\n\r\nPharmEasy Senior Executive Leadership\r\n\r\nNational Consumer Helpline (Government of India)\r\n\r\nConsumer Court under Consumer Protection Act, 2019\r\n\r\nRelevant Pharmaceutical Regulatory Authorities\r\n\r\nAny other legal body as applicable\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope PharmEasy will resolve the matter before such steps become necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n9. Conclusion\r\n\r\nPharmEasy is expected to maintain the highest standards of safety,\r\naccuracy, and transparency, especially when dealing with healthcare\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nAll I seek is:\r\n\r\nA complete and professional investigation\r\n\r\nTransparent communication\r\n\r\nA fair resolution (replacement or refund)\r\n\r\n\r\nI trust your team will handle this matter with the seriousness it deserves\r\nand respond urgently.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\nRohan\r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\n\r\nThis email contains proprietary, business-confidential, \r\nand/or privileged material.

PharmEasy Customer Support Team,\r\nGrievance Redressal Department,\r\nand Senior Management,\r\n\r\nI am writing this email as a FINAL, URGENT, and HIGH-PRIORITY ESCALATION\r\nregarding the severe mishandling and procedural lapses associated with my\r\norder Order ID: 653726198280949760.\r\n\r\nI request you to read this email completely and carefully, as every point\r\nmentioned below is critical and requires immediate senior-level attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n1. Summary of the Issue – Missing and Wrong Medicines\r\n\r\nI had ordered 5 medicines/products under the above-mentioned order ID.\r\nHowever, during delivery:\r\n\r\nI received only 2 items,\r\n\r\nAnd both items were wrong/incorrect medicines,\r\n\r\nThe remaining 3 items were completely missing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not a minor operational error. This is a serious breach of order\r\nintegrity, especially in the pharmaceutical industry where accuracy\r\ndirectly affects customer health and safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n2. Incomplete and Procedurally Incorrect Investigation\r\n\r\nI was informed that my complaint was closed because your team reviewed only\r\nthe dispatch video and found no issue.\r\n\r\nWith due respect, I want to make it very clear that:\r\n\r\nA dispatch-level video alone does NOT constitute a complete investigation.\r\n\r\nA standard and fair investigation for missing or incorrect medicines must\r\ninclude:\r\n\r\nReview of CCTV footage from all hubs\r\n\r\nTransit-level verification of the parcel\r\n\r\nSorting-center camera checks\r\n\r\nDetailed chain-of-custody tracking\r\n\r\nWeight log comparison at every point\r\n\r\nVerification of movement and scan logs\r\n\r\nDelivery station handover footage\r\n\r\nRe-bagging or re-routing investigation\r\n\r\n\r\nClosing a serious complaint based only on the dispatch video is\r\noperationally incomplete, logically insufficient, and professionally\r\nunacceptable.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n3. Request for Full Chain-of-Custody Investigation\r\n\r\nI formally request PharmEasy to conduct a complete and transparent\r\nchain-of-custody investigation, including:\r\n\r\nA. CCTV Footage Review (Mandatory)\r\n\r\nYou must review the CCTV footage of:\r\n\r\nPacking center\r\n\r\nFirst sorting warehouse\r\n\r\nEvery transit and routing hub\r\n\r\nRegional processing centers\r\n\r\nFinal delivery hub\r\n\r\nDelivery station sorting area\r\n\r\nPick-up and handover section\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Verification of Weight Logs\r\n\r\nA detailed comparison of:\r\n\r\nInitial package weight at the origin\r\n\r\nWeight during each hub scan\r\n\r\nWeight during re-bagging\r\n\r\nFinal delivery station weight\r\n\r\n\r\nAny mismatch will clearly show missing items.\r\n\r\nC. Movement & Scan Audit\r\n\r\nA full audit should include:\r\n\r\nOutbound scan\r\n\r\nInbound scans at all hubs\r\n\r\nRouting details\r\n\r\nSorting belt entries\r\n\r\nDelivery executive pickup scan\r\n\r\nRe-scan or re-routing logs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n4. Request for Transparency – Provide Relevant CCTV Footage\r\n\r\nOnce the investigation is completed, I request that the relevant CCTV\r\nfootage, including:\r\n\r\nPacking\r\n\r\nSorting\r\n\r\nHub movement\r\n\r\nDelivery station handling\r\n\r\n\r\nbe shared with me for transparency, as I have every right to verify how my\r\nparcel was handled at each stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n5. Strong Red Flags Indicating Mishandling\r\n\r\nReceiving:\r\n\r\nWrong items,\r\n\r\nMissing items,\r\n\r\nIncorrect delivery quantity,\r\n\r\n\r\nclearly indicates that:\r\n\r\nThe parcel was either mishandled during transit,\r\nor\r\n\r\nIncorrectly sorted or packed,\r\nor\r\n\r\nMisrouted at a particular hub,\r\nor\r\n\r\nTampered with or misplaced during the chain movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly a thorough multi-hub investigation can find the exact failure point.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n6. Immediate and Suitable Resolution Expected\r\n\r\nConsidering the severity of the issue, I expect PharmEasy to provide one of\r\nthe following resolutions:\r\n\r\n✔ Option 1: Replacement\r\n\r\nProvide all the correct medicines/products that I originally ordered.\r\n\r\n✔ Option 2: Full Refund\r\n\r\nIf replacement is not possible, initiate a complete refund for all missing\r\nand incorrect items.\r\n\r\nA fair and customer-centric resolution is expected and required.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n7. Urgent Actions Required\r\n\r\nPlease proceed with:\r\n\r\n1. Reopening my complaint\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Initiating a multi-hub chain-of-custody audit\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Reviewing all hub CCTV footage\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Verifying weight logs\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Sharing relevant CCTV footage with me\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Providing either replacement or refund\r\n\r\n\r\n7.

CCTV Footage Review (Mandatory)\r\n\r\nYou must review the CCTV footage of:\r\n\r\nPacking center\r\n\r\nFirst sorting warehouse\r\n\r\nEvery transit and routing hub\r\n\r\nRegional processing centers\r\n\r\nFinal delivery hub\r\n\r\nDelivery station sorting area\r\n\r\nPick-up and handover section\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Verification of Weight Logs\r\n\r\nA detailed comparison of:\r\n\r\nInitial package weight at the origin\r\n\r\nWeight during each hub scan\r\n\r\nWeight during re-bagging\r\n\r\nFinal delivery station weight\r\n\r\n\r\nAny mismatch will clearly show missing items.\r\n\r\nC. Movement & Scan Audit\r\n\r\nA full audit should include:\r\n\r\nOutbound scan\r\n\r\nInbound scans at all hubs\r\n\r\nRouting details\r\n\r\nSorting belt entries\r\n\r\nDelivery executive pickup scan\r\n\r\nRe-scan or re-routing logs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n4. Request for Transparency – Provide Relevant CCTV Footage\r\n\r\nOnce the investigation is completed, I request that the relevant CCTV\r\nfootage, including:\r\n\r\nPacking\r\n\r\nSorting\r\n\r\nHub movement\r\n\r\nDelivery station handling\r\n\r\n\r\nbe shared with me for transparency, as I have every right to verify how my\r\nparcel was handled at each stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n5. Strong Red Flags Indicating Mishandling\r\n\r\nReceiving:\r\n\r\nWrong items,\r\n\r\nMissing items,\r\n\r\nIncorrect delivery quantity,\r\n\r\n\r\nclearly indicates that:\r\n\r\nThe parcel was either mishandled during transit,\r\nor\r\n\r\nIncorrectly sorted or packed,\r\nor\r\n\r\nMisrouted at a particular hub,\r\nor\r\n\r\nTampered with or misplaced during the chain movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly a thorough multi-hub investigation can find the exact failure point.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n6. Immediate and Suitable Resolution Expected\r\n\r\nConsidering the severity of the issue, I expect PharmEasy to provide one of\r\nthe following resolutions:\r\n\r\n✔ Option 1: Replacement\r\n\r\nProvide all the correct medicines/products that I originally ordered.\r\n\r\n✔ Option 2: Full Refund\r\n\r\nIf replacement is not possible, initiate a complete refund for all missing\r\nand incorrect items.\r\n\r\nA fair and customer-centric resolution is expected and required.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n7. Urgent Actions Required\r\n\r\nPlease proceed with:\r\n\r\n1. Reopening my complaint\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Initiating a multi-hub chain-of-custody audit\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Reviewing all hub CCTV footage\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Verifying weight logs\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Sharing relevant CCTV footage with me\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Providing either replacement or refund\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Ensuring accountability through internal teams\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n8. Final Warning Before External Escalation\r\n\r\nI want to state clearly, respectfully, and firmly:\r\n\r\nIf this complaint is again closed without:\r\n\r\nA complete CCTV review,\r\n\r\nA full chain-of-custody audit,\r\n\r\nA transparent and justified resolution,\r\n\r\n\r\nI will be left with no choice but to escalate this matter further to:\r\n\r\nPharmEasy Senior Executive Leadership\r\n\r\nNational Consumer Helpline (Government of India)\r\n\r\nConsumer Court under Consumer Protection Act, 2019\r\n\r\nRelevant Pharmaceutical Regulatory Authorities\r\n\r\nAny other legal body as applicable\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope PharmEasy will resolve the matter before such steps become necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n9. Conclusion\r\n\r\nPharmEasy is expected to maintain the highest standards of safety,\r\naccuracy, and transparency, especially when dealing with healthcare\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nAll I seek is:\r\n\r\nA complete and professional investigation\r\n\r\nTransparent communication\r\n\r\nA fair resolution (replacement or refund)\r\n\r\n\r\nI trust your team will handle this matter with the seriousness it deserves\r\nand respond urgently.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\nRohan\r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\n\r\nThis email contains proprietary, business-confidential, \r\nand/or privileged material.

Redressal Department,\r\nand Senior Management,\r\n\r\nI am writing this email as a FINAL, URGENT, and HIGH-PRIORITY ESCALATION\r\nregarding the severe mishandling and procedural lapses associated with my\r\norder Order ID: 653726198280949760.\r\n\r\nI request you to read this email completely and carefully, as every point\r\nmentioned below is critical and requires immediate senior-level attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n1. Summary of the Issue – Missing and Wrong Medicines\r\n\r\nI had ordered 5 medicines/products under the above-mentioned order ID.\r\nHowever, during delivery:\r\n\r\nI received only 2 items,\r\n\r\nAnd both items were wrong/incorrect medicines,\r\n\r\nThe remaining 3 items were completely missing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not a minor operational error. This is a serious breach of order\r\nintegrity, especially in the pharmaceutical industry where accuracy\r\ndirectly affects customer health and safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n2. Incomplete and Procedurally Incorrect Investigation\r\n\r\nI was informed that my complaint was closed because your team reviewed only\r\nthe dispatch video and found no issue.\r\n\r\nWith due respect, I want to make it very clear that:\r\n\r\nA dispatch-level video alone does NOT constitute a complete investigation.\r\n\r\nA standard and fair investigation for missing or incorrect medicines must\r\ninclude:\r\n\r\nReview of CCTV footage from all hubs\r\n\r\nTransit-level verification of the parcel\r\n\r\nSorting-center camera checks\r\n\r\nDetailed chain-of-custody tracking\r\n\r\nWeight log comparison at every point\r\n\r\nVerification of movement and scan logs\r\n\r\nDelivery station handover footage\r\n\r\nRe-bagging or re-routing investigation\r\n\r\n\r\nClosing a serious complaint based only on the dispatch video is\r\noperationally incomplete, logically insufficient, and professionally\r\nunacceptable.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n3. Request for Full Chain-of-Custody Investigation\r\n\r\nI formally request PharmEasy to conduct a complete and transparent\r\nchain-of-custody investigation, including:\r\n\r\nA. CCTV Footage Review (Mandatory)\r\n\r\nYou must review the CCTV footage of:\r\n\r\nPacking center\r\n\r\nFirst sorting warehouse\r\n\r\nEvery transit and routing hub\r\n\r\nRegional processing centers\r\n\r\nFinal delivery hub\r\n\r\nDelivery station sorting area\r\n\r\nPick-up and handover section\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Verification of Weight Logs\r\n\r\nA detailed comparison of:\r\n\r\nInitial package weight at the origin\r\n\r\nWeight during each hub scan\r\n\r\nWeight during re-bagging\r\n\r\nFinal delivery station weight\r\n\r\n\r\nAny mismatch will clearly show missing items.\r\n\r\nC. Movement & Scan Audit\r\n\r\nA full audit should include:\r\n\r\nOutbound scan\r\n\r\nInbound scans at all hubs\r\n\r\nRouting details\r\n\r\nSorting belt entries\r\n\r\nDelivery executive pickup scan\r\n\r\nRe-scan or re-routing logs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n4. Request for Transparency – Provide Relevant CCTV Footage\r\n\r\nOnce the investigation is completed, I request that the relevant CCTV\r\nfootage, including:\r\n\r\nPacking\r\n\r\nSorting\r\n\r\nHub movement\r\n\r\nDelivery station handling\r\n\r\n\r\nbe shared with me for transparency, as I have every right to verify how my\r\nparcel was handled at each stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n5. Strong Red Flags Indicating Mishandling\r\n\r\nReceiving:\r\n\r\nWrong items,\r\n\r\nMissing items,\r\n\r\nIncorrect delivery quantity,\r\n\r\n\r\nclearly indicates that:\r\n\r\nThe parcel was either mishandled during transit,\r\nor\r\n\r\nIncorrectly sorted or packed,\r\nor\r\n\r\nMisrouted at a particular hub,\r\nor\r\n\r\nTampered with or misplaced during the chain movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly a thorough multi-hub investigation can find the exact failure point.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n6. Immediate and Suitable Resolution Expected\r\n\r\nConsidering the severity of the issue, I expect PharmEasy to provide one of\r\nthe following resolutions:\r\n\r\n✔ Option 1: Replacement\r\n\r\nProvide all the correct medicines/products that I originally ordered.\r\n\r\n✔ Option 2: Full Refund\r\n\r\nIf replacement is not possible, initiate a complete refund for all missing\r\nand incorrect items.\r\n\r\nA fair and customer-centric resolution is expected and required.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n7. Urgent Actions Required\r\n\r\nPlease proceed with:\r\n\r\n1. Reopening my complaint\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Initiating a multi-hub chain-of-custody audit\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Reviewing all hub CCTV footage\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Verifying weight logs\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Sharing relevant CCTV footage with me\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Providing either replacement or refund\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Ensuring accountability through internal teams\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n8. Final Warning Before External Escalation\r\n\r\nI want to state clearly, respectfully, and firmly:\r\n\r\nIf this complaint is again closed without:\r\n\r\nA complete CCTV review,\r\n\r\nA full chain-of-custody audit,\r\n\r\nA transparent and justified resolution,\r\n\r\n\r\nI will be left with no choice but to escalate this matter further to:\r\n\r\nPharmEasy Senior Executive Leadership\r\n\r\nNational Consumer Helpline (Government of India)\r\n\r\nConsumer Court under Consumer Protection Act, 2019\r\n\r\nRelevant Pharmaceutical Regulatory Authorities\r\n\r\nAny other legal body as applicable\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope PharmEasy will resolve the matter before such steps become necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n9. Conclusion\r\n\r\nPharmEasy is expected to maintain the highest standards of safety,\r\naccuracy, and transparency, especially when dealing with healthcare\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nAll I seek is:\r\n\r\nA complete and professional investigation\r\n\r\nTransparent communication\r\n\r\nA fair resolution (replacement or refund)\r\n\r\n\r\nI trust your team will handle this matter with the seriousness it deserves\r\nand respond urgently.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\nRohan\r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\n\r\nThis email contains proprietary, business-confidential, \r\nand/or privileged material.
